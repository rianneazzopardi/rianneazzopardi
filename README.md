Hi! I'm a 19 year old aspiring software engineer currently reading for a B.Sc(IT)(Hons) in Software
Development at the University of Malta. Since a young age, I have always shown an interest in
technology, so it was no surprise when at age 13, I decided that Software Engineering
will be my career path. Since then, I have been working on constantly learning new tools and languages
that will aid me in my career. 

Languages, Frameworks & Tools:
Java, C, C#, Python (including ML packages), SQL, MySQL, Postgres, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Spring, .NET MAUI, Android Studio
